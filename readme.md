This app was created using ruby on rails, sidekiq, redis, and uses nokogiri, diffbot, alchemyAPI and a variety of other gems. The main purpose of the app was to scrape data from news articles, and also attempt to return a positive/negative sentiment score from Alchemy API in terms of the content coming from each article. The categories branch of the project also adds a crawling feature, aka it will take the first 10 news articles from a yahoo search and add them to the project, in addition to adding 'topics' so that users are able to create unique topics that they can watch and view the scores for. One of the major difficulties in the project was working to make sure that diffbot was able to pull back data from each article (some articles contain videos, or URL's that don't function with diffbot)
